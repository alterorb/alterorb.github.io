## FAQ

## What are the requirements to run AlterOrb?
AlterOrb requires at minimum Java version 8 installed on your computer.
MacOS users: Make sure you have installed the JDK and not the JRE only (open the terminal and type java --version, if it works everything is setup correctly)

## Where can i download Java?
You can find download links for java at [https://adoptopenjdk.net/](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

## I've opened/extracted the launcher with Winrar, what should i do next?
You don't extract the alterorb-launcher.jar archive! If by double clicking it opens winrar you need to fix your file associations, a nifty tool to fix this on windows is [jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/).
